## Dataset

## Summary of Findings


I found that there is a positive relationship between member birth year and duration spent on trips. Given that this dataset is about a bike sharing platform, the bikes(bike_id) are going to be used more than once, but some, such as bike id no 5175 appears to be used much more than other bikes(172 times) 


## Key Insights for Presentation


In the presentation I look at member gender and user type and how that affects duration spent on trips. While the gender male has a higher count than the rest, meaning there are more male users, it has the lowest on duration spent on trips. The gender group other has a higher duration.
